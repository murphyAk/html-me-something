      <h2>Where do you start believing?</h2>
      <p>Your favorite celebrity has an extra toe. Not a toe-double, I mean a sixth toe - on the right foot. It might be hard to believe, but what if I told you that I saw it in-person? Maybe I’m just lying. If I had a picture? Well, it could be photoshop. How about a candid video of the actor walking barefoot at the beach? Is there a point where you would start to believe, even if you never saw it for yourself?</p>

        <h3>When seeing is not always believing</h3>
        <p>Out of spoken words, photographs, and video, video media is the most reliable source of reality, because it is the most difficult to edit and doctor out of the three. But with deepfakes, we must start questioning the validity of video evidence.</p>

      <h3>Evolving counterfeit media</h3>
      <article>
        <p>Deepfakes are to videos as what photoshop is to pictures. It allows manipulation and doctoring of video media. With this technology, false information can spread with credibility, fooling the viewers into believing a lie. While we already have some laws against false content, a closer look to regulate deepfakes is necessary, to make sure the new technologies don’t outpace our current policies.</p>
